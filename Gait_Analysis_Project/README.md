## 🚶‍♂️ Gait Analysis & Biomechanical Feature Extraction
This repository contains a specialized MATLAB toolset developed to process and analyze human locomotion data. The project transforms raw kinematic data from SimTK/OpenSim into clinical gait parameters.

## 🚀 Key Technical Features
**1. Automated Event Detection**
* **Heel-Strike (HS) Detection:**  The system employs an adaptive detection logic. It utilizes Hip Flexion peaks for sensor-based/static trials and Knee Extension minima (via negative transform -Knee_Angle) for high-fidelity IK data, ensuring robust cycle segmentation across different data qualities.

* **Toe-Off (TO) Estimation:** Instead of a fixed 60% threshold, the algorithm dynamically identifies TO by locating the Peak Knee Flexion point. This kinematic-based approach adapts to the subject’s unique movement economy in both static and dynamic conditions.

**2. Data Normalization & Statistics**
* **Temporal Normalization:** Each stride is resampled to a 100-point vector (0-100% of the gait cycle) using linear interpolation (interp1).
* **Ensemble Averaging:** Calculates the Mean and Standard Deviation (SD) across all identified strides to create a representative gait profile.

**3. Clinical Symmetry Analysis**
* Calculates the Symmetry Index (SI) between the right and Left knee peak flexion.
* Includes a built-in interpreter for clinical significance (based on a 10% asymmetry threshold).

**4. Advanced Visualization**
* Generates Mean ± SD shaded area plots (using fill) to visualize gait stability and variability. [Gait Analysis Output!](Gait_Analysis_Project/Figures/Knee_Angle_Mean_SD_left_leg.png)
* Automatic phase labeling (STANCE vs. SWING) on the kinematic plots.
  
**5. Spatio-Temporal Validation**
* **Static Noise vs. Actual Gait:** Observation: Static trials showed an unrealistic Cadence (~255 steps/min).
* Insight: This was identified as sensor micro-oscillations/noise being captured as peaks. It serves as a perfect example of why thresholding is critical in real-world biomechanics.

* **Dynamic Gait Metrics:** Result: Captured a Stride Duration of 0.67s and a Cadence of 157 steps/min.
* Conclusion: Despite the "Slow" label in the source file, the kinematic analysis proves a rapid pace, showcasing the tool's ability to validate trial metadata against actual movement data.

## 🔍 Static vs. Dynamic Benchmarking
During development, the toolset was validated across two distinct data states: 
Static Calibration Trial: Initial testing on static files (GIL01_static.mot) demonstrated the algorithm's stability. While the Range of Motion (ROM) remained <1^, the event detection logic successfully identified minimal postural oscillations. 
Dynamic IK Trial: Final validation used Inverse Kinematics (IK) data from the GIL01_slow3_ik trial. The tool successfully captured a natural ROM of 65^ and segmented the gait cycles for a 10-year-old subject. 
Note on Signal Integrity: To evaluate the raw robustness of the detection logic, all analyses were performed on unfiltered signals. This approach confirmed that the peak-detection algorithms remain accurate even without pre-processing.
